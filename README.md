  - How to save data in browser's local storage

  ```js
  const loadTasks = () => {
  	const data = JSON.parse(localStorage['taskList']);
  	if (data.length) setTaskList(data);
  };

  const saveTasks = () => {
  	localStorage.setItem('taskList', JSON.stringify(taskList));
  };

  // Load tasks from local storage when app is launched
  useEffect(loadTasks, []);
  // Save tasks in local storage if tasks get changed (also run when it loads)
  useEffect(saveTasks, [taskList]);
  ```
